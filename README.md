## Website 1 = Sketch London 
https://sketch.london

Description and Community I want to Contribute to: 

Sketch London is a famed townhouse tearoom that attracts locals and tourists. Its award-winning menu and stylish interiors has made it one of the world's most famous collection of restaurants. I want to help put both locals and tourists in London who want to pay a visit to this dazzling venue and improve their overall experience and perception of Sketch.

### Visibility of system status 
-	On the main page, there is a noticeable delay in the popping up of the different areas within the restaurant and the time I hover my clicker over it.
- The side menus that represents “Reservation and Menu” and the Sketch toggle bar take several seconds to pop up, leaving the users having to spend more time staring at the awkward objects on the screen.

Evaluation: Overall, there isn’t appropriate feedback within reasonable time, as it takes a while for the popups and side menus on the main page to appear.  
### Match between system and the real world 
-	If one were to not click on anything, you would only see these six obscure objects, which are each supposedly representing a part of the restaurant, floating around, with no indication as to what they are and why they are represented by objects looking like that. There seems to be no correlation for the aesthetic of the floating objects with the part of the restaurant that they represent. 
-	Upon clicking on one of the individual restaurant areas, such as “the Parlor”, there is no indication of how the place looks like. Instead, there is only a doodle in the background. 

Evaluation: For those who have never been to the restaurant before, it is safe to say that they will be even more perplexed as to what the restaurant has to offer, because the website doesn’t portray an accurate visual representation of what is in there. 
### User control and freedom 
- Despite the delay in popups, the website offers quite a few options for the website visitor to explore through the side menus. 
-	However, if one were to click on “The Glade”, and pressed on “play” in order to play a new game of sketching a garden, if the user clicked that by mistake and meant to click the other option of “Book”, and if they were to click the back button, it takes them back to the main page, rather than taking them back to the “book”/”play” option popup. 

Evaluation: Users who make mistakes in choosing their action of choice on the site of each individual area of the restaurant will have to go all the way back to the main menu, which can cause frustrations and is an unnecessary inconvenience. 
### Consistency and standards 
-	The features of the website seem to be consistent with one another. All the individual sites have similar icons, menus, and stick to the color scheme that they represent on the main website. 

Evaluation: Consistency, however awkward it may look, seems to be maintained throughout the website’s different locations. 
### Error prevention 
-	There are appropriate pop up messages in places where users might make errors. For instance, when trying to make a lunch reservation at the Lecture Room and Library in Sketch, it asks for the number of people and date of intended visit, before going ahead, it sends a pop up asking if the information is correct before moving forward and confirming the reservation, to avoid errors. 

### Recognition rather than Recall 
- The website doesn't push visitors to remember too much information. Everything is labelled properly, and information is repeated in areas where it needs to be. For example, on the individual pages, there is an Info menu that repeats the timings and the meals available in that particular part of the restaurant, which is also there on the main page. 
- However, instead of representing the different restaurants with those obscure designs, it would be better to represent them with designs that mirror the name of the part of the restaurant, or an icon that reflects the style, so that users can easily select their option. Although the name of the part of the restaurant pops up when you clicl on the obscure design, there is still a few seconds before doing that where the user is forced to recall which floating object represents the part of the restaurant that they're interested in visiting. 

Evaluation: Although the the floating objects on the main page to prompt some uneasiness and force users to recall some information, the rest of the website makes it easy to recognize the functions and features. 

### Flexibility and efficiency of use
- The website isn't efficient. For instance, when you click on the East Bar and Pods area, the page doesn't say that there are no bookings required for this area. Oddly, there is a "Book" tab, and when you click on it, it says "Walk-in basis, priority to diners." This slows things down for the user and makes the website more inefficient. 

Evaluation: The main page of the individual sites should have information that will help the users make their decisions more quicker, rather than only have an artsy background which serves no purpose. 

### Aesthetic and minimalist design
- It is safe to say that the signal-to-noise ratio is very low. The website has numerous animations, loud art, and distracting visuals that take away from the content it is trying to present and communicate. On the individual pages, instead of directly showing them the booking menu, they ask if you want to play a game, which is another unnecessary distraction that makes it harder for the user to reach their end goal of making a reservation. 


Evaluation: The design of the page is not minimalist and provides too many distractions that take away from the purpose of the site. 


### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Since error prevention on the sketch website is good, it is hard for a user to make an error. When an error is made, there are appropiate pop up messages and options to make other choices to recover from it. 

### Help and documentation
- The sketch website does a good job of providing helpful documentation. There is an FAQ page that answers detailed questions that users may have about visiting the restaurant, and they also provide an email and a phone number to contact. 




## Website 2 = Yale School of Arts
https://www.art.yale.edu

Description and Community I want to Contribute to: 

The Yale School of Arts is the first professional fine arts school in the United States, and is an extremely well-reputed institution. They offer graduate courses in graphic design, painting/printmaking, photography, or sculpture. I want to help art students and professionals who are looking to apply to Yale to further their academic pursuits by showing how their experience can be made easier with a better website.

Visbility (1), Match with real world(2), User Control (1), Consistency (3), Error Prevention (2),  Recognition over Recall (1), Flexibility (1), Aesthetic (3), Error Recovery (1),  Help and Documentation (1)

### Visibility of system status 
-	The system status seems to be quite visible, and the user can easily know what state the website is in while performing different functions. 

### Match between system and the real world 
-	The website doesn't include artworks or projects of the students of the school of art, and includes a background of a kangaroo getting watered. There aren't images of the faculty or the department either. These visuals don't mirror the real world experience of attending this school. 

Evaluation: Although user's language is maintained, there isn't much adherence to real-world conventions. So, the website proves to be a poor reflection of the actual experience of attending Yale School of Arts. 

### User control and freedom 
- It is easy for users to go back to what they were previously viewing if they changed their mind. All the exit commands are accomplished by simply clicking the Back key, and the side menu always remains so that users can directly go to individual site of choice. 

### Consistency and standards 
-	There are instances where similar colors are used to represent different things within the website. For instance, the blue box that includes the introductory paragraph on most of the pages in the website is used to include body paragraphs in other pages. Since users would initially associate the blue box for the introductory content, it can be visually confusing when that trend is broken. 
- Also, there are certain words that are hyperlinked (contain a link to a website), but those words aren't underlined or given a different color, which can cause confusion amongst users as to where they should click to view the link. 

Evaluation: Although not an extreme hindrance to achieving the user's goals, it would be better to evaluate how to improve both the internal and external consistency.  

### Error prevention 
-	 As stated previously, there are certain words that contain links to go to another website, but many of these words aren't differentiated from the others. If the user clicks on it by mistake, it immediately takes you to the website. It would be helpful to include a popup that asks the user whether or not they want to be redirected to that website. 

Evaluation: Although the probability of committing an error on a site like this is less, it could be even lesser if including another popup before being redirected to another website. 

### Recognition rather than Recall 
- Since the website doesn't present too much information, there is no real need for the user to remember too much. The side menu is always present and makes it easy for the user to go back to one of those options if they need to recall information from those different pages of the site. 

### Flexibility and efficiency of use
- The website is quite flexible and allows users to reach their end goal quickly. All the main tasks are appropriately labelled on the side menu. 


### Aesthetic and minimalist design
- The aesthetic of this website is extremely confusing and distracts the viewer from exploring what the school has to offer. Since it is a reputable arts school, it is ironic that the website uses gaudy color schemes and animated backgrounds (which can be paused) on its website. The visual design does not focus on the essentials, and it mostly seems irrelevant. The layout of the website is also not structured logically. 

Evaluation: The design of the page is not minimalist and provides too many distractions that take away from the purpose of the site. 

### Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- When entering false information on the Sign in to Yale School of Art page through the visitor login, no error message popped up. Rather, the page just refreshed with no indication of wrong information being inputted previously. 

Evaluation: The website fails to clearly inform the user when an error, in this case entering wrong login credentials, has occured. It doesn't provide concise instructions on how to overcome the error either. 

### Help and documentation
- Although the website includes a Contact page with different emails and numbers to contact for further information, there is no FAQ page regarding and relating to information on that website. Including one could reduce administrative burdens for the School of Arts team. 

Evaluation: The website can add an extra section to answer questions people have about navigating the website/application to the school rather than making them reach out the main office for everything.
